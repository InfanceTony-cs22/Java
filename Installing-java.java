Setting Up Your Java Environment

  Topic:

On Day 1, we focus on setting up your Java development environment. This includes installing Java and a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code).


  Step 1: Install Java

To start programming in Java, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. Follow these steps to install Java:

Visit the Oracle JDK download page (for Oracle JDK) or the AdoptOpenJDK website (for OpenJDK).
Download the appropriate JDK version for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

  
Step 2: Verify Java Installation

After installing Java, you should verify that it's correctly installed. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type the following command:

    java -version

      
      Step 3: Install a Code Editor or IDE

You'll also need a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Java code efficiently. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular choice for Java development. Here's how to set up VS Code for Java:

Install VS Code if you haven't already: Download VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.

Install the "Java Extension Pack" for VS Code: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (click on the square icon on the left sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Java Extension Pack," and install it.

  

Step 4: Create Your First Java Program

Now that your Java environment is set up, you can create your first Java program. In VS Code:

Create a new Java file by clicking on the "File" menu, selecting "New File," and saving it with a .java extension (e.g., HelloWorld.java).


Step 5: Compile and Run the Program

Open a terminal within VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).

Navigate to the directory where your Java file is located using the cd command (e.g., cd /path/to/your/java/program).

Compile your Java program using the javac command followed by the filename
